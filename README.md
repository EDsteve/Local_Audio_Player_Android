## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Hedgehog or newer
- JDK 17+
- Android device or emulator running Android 14+

### Build & Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EDsteve/Local_Audio_Player_Android.git
```

2. Open in Android Studio

3. Sync Gradle and build the project

4. Run on your device or emulator

### Permissions

The app uses:
- **Storage Access Framework (SAF)** - For accessing music files (no storage permissions needed)
- **Internet** - For Last.fm API genre lookups (optional, works offline with cache)

## Usage

1. **First Launch:** Tap "Add Folder" to select a music folder
2. **Browse:** Use the bottom navigation to switch between Home, Folders, and Genres
3. **Play:** Tap any track to play, or tap the play button on a folder to play all tracks
4. **Navigate:** Tap a folder name to browse its contents, tap back to return
5. **Search:** Use the search bar on any screen to find tracks
6. **Refresh Genres:** Tap the refresh button (🔄) in the Genres screen to re-scan with updated mappings

### Genre Detection

The app automatically detects genres using the Last.fm API:
- On first scan, each unique artist is looked up on Last.fm
- The returned tags are mapped to one of 20 genre categories
- Results are cached locally for instant subsequent scans
- If genres seem incorrect, use the refresh button to re-scan
